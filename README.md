# HashBite ðŸ¦‡

**HashBite** is a powerful and easy-to-use Python program designed to crack hashed passwords using the `hashlib` module via a **wordlist attack**. It supports a wide range of hash algorithms and offers a simple interface to attempt cracking hashes by comparing each hash with possible plaintext values from a wordlist. Supported algorithms include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, and many more.

## Features

- **Multiple Hashing Algorithms**: Supports a variety of popular hashing algorithms including SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5, and others.
- **Built in wordlists**: Comes prepackaged with rockyou.txt darkweb2017.txt and cain&abel.txt
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface with colored output and interactive prompts.
- **Open Source**: Completely open-source, built with Python.

## Supported Algorithms

The following hashing algorithms are supported and guaranteed to work:

- SHA1
- SHA224
- SHA256
- SHA384
- SHA512
- SHA3_224
- SHA3_256
- SHA3_384
- SHA3_512
- MD5
- Blake2b
- Blake2s
- Shake_128
